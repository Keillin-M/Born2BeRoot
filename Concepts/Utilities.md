# üõ†Ô∏è Common Linux Utilities Explained

## üîç grep (Global Regular Expression Print)

- **What it means:**  
The name `grep` comes from the command used in the text editor ed: **g/re/p** which stands for *global / regular expression / print*. It means ‚Äúsearch globally for a pattern and print the matching lines.‚Äù

- **What it does:**  
`grep` searches for text patterns (like words or phrases) inside files or input and shows you the matching lines.
The `-v` option means **invert match**

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
grep "apple" fruits.txt
```
This finds and prints all lines in fruits.txt that contain the word "apple".

- **Why it's useful:**
You can quickly search and filter text to find what you need.

## grep -q

- **What it means:**  
The `-q` option means **quiet** or **silent** mode.

- **What it does:**  
`grep -q` searches for the pattern but **does not output anything**. It only sets the exit status:
  - Exit status `0` means the pattern was found.  
  - Exit status `1` means the pattern was not found.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
grep -q "apple" fruits.txt
```
This checks if "apple" is in fruits.txt without printing any result.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
awk '{sum += $1} END {print "Total:", sum}' numbers.txt
```
This adds up the first column of all lines in numbers.txt and prints the total at the end.

- ***Why it's useful:***
Great for calculating totals, averages, or printing final results after processing data.

- Default package manager on Debian-based systems.
- Lightweight, fast, and widely used in scripts and terminals.
- Comes pre-installed in most systems.

- **aptitude:**
- A more advanced, interactive package manager.
- Can be used in text-based GUI mode or via command line.
- Better at resolving complex dependencies automatically.
- Not installed by default ‚Äî must be installed manually:
```bash
sudo apt install aptitude
```
- **When to use which?**
- Use apt for everyday tasks ‚Äî it's simple and quick.
- Use aptitude if you're dealing with tricky dependency issues or prefer a menu-style interface in the terminal.

## üîê AppArmor

- **What it means:**  
**AppArmor** stands for **Application Armor**.

- **What it does:**  
AppArmor is a Linux **security module** that controls what programs can do by enforcing **per-application access rules**. It uses profiles to restrict how a program can interact with files, networks, and other system resources.

- **Simple example:**
AppArmor can restrict a web server so it:
- Can read `/var/www/`
- Cannot access `/home/user/` or `/etc/shadow`

- **Why it's useful:**  
Even if a program is exploited, AppArmor can **limit the damage** it can do. It's a form of **mandatory access control (MAC)**, adding another layer of security on top of traditional file permissions.

- **Where it's used:**  
- Commonly used in **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, and **openSUSE**.
- Helps protect services like `nginx`, `mysql`, `snap`, and more.

- **Commands to manage AppArmor:**
```bash
sudo aa-status         # Show AppArmor status
sudo aa-enforce profile_name   # Enforce a specific profile
sudo aa-disable profile_name   # Disable a specific profile
```
