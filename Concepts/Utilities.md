# Common Linux Utilities Explained

## grep (Global Regular Expression Print)

- **What it means:**  
The name `grep` comes from the command used in the text editor ed: **g/re/p** which stands for *global / regular expression / print*. It means “search globally for a pattern and print the matching lines.”

- **What it does:**  
`grep` searches for text patterns (like words or phrases) inside files or input and shows you the matching lines.
The `-v` option means **invert match**

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
grep "apple" fruits.txt
```
This finds and prints all lines in fruits.txt that contain the word "apple".

- **Why it's useful:**
You can quickly search and filter text to find what you need.

## grep -q

- **What it means:**  
The `-q` option means **quiet** or **silent** mode.

- **What it does:**  
`grep -q` searches for the pattern but **does not output anything**. It only sets the exit status:
  - Exit status `0` means the pattern was found.  
  - Exit status `1` means the pattern was not found.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
grep -q "apple" fruits.txt
```
This checks if "apple" is in fruits.txt without printing any result.

- **Why it's useful:**
Useful in scripts when you just want to check if a pattern exists without displaying the matching lines.

## awk 
- **What it means:**
awk is named after its creators — Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan.

- **What it does:**
awk is a powerful text-processing tool. It reads text line by line, splits it into fields (columns), and lets you select, format, or change parts of the text based on patterns.

- **Simple example:**
```bash
awk '{print $1}' fruits.txt
```
This prints the first column (word) of each line from fruits.txt.

- **Why it's useful:**
Great for working with structured text like tables or logs where you want to extract or modify columns.

## awk END

- **What it means:**  
`END` is a special pattern in `awk` that runs after processing all input lines.

- **What it does:**  
Commands inside the `END` block execute once after all lines have been read, useful for summary or final output.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
awk '{sum += $1} END {print "Total:", sum}' numbers.txt
```
This adds up the first column of all lines in numbers.txt and prints the total at the end.

- ***Why it's useful:***
Great for calculating totals, averages, or printing final results after processing data.

## lscpu

- **What it means:**  
`lscpu` stands for **List CPU**. It shows detailed information about your computer’s CPU architecture.

- **What it does:**  
When you run `lscpu`, it displays details like the number of CPUs, cores, threads, CPU model, speed, and more.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
lscpu
```
This command outputs a summary of your CPU’s hardware info.

- **Why it's useful:**
It helps you quickly understand the processor specs of your system without digging through system files.

## uname

- **What it means:**  
`uname` stands for **Unix Name**. It shows information about your operating system.

- **What it does:**  
Running `uname` prints details like the system name, kernel version, and machine hardware info.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
uname -a
```
This command shows all available system information in one line (kernel name, version, hostname, etc.).

- **Why it's useful:**
It’s a quick way to check which OS and kernel your system is running.

## nproc

- **What it means:**  
`nproc` stands for **number of processors**.

- **What it does:**  
It shows how many CPU cores or processing units are available on your system.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
nproc
```
This command prints the number of CPU cores your system can use.

- **Why it's useful:**
Useful for scripts or programs that want to optimize performance by knowing how many processors are available.

## free -m

- **What it means:**  
`free` shows memory usage, and the `-m` option displays the information in **megabytes**.

- **What it does:**  
It displays how much RAM and swap memory your system is using and how much is free.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
free -m
```
This prints memory usage in megabytes, making it easier to read.

- **Why it's useful:**
Helps you quickly check your system’s memory status and troubleshoot performance issues.

## df

- **What it means:**  
`df` stands for **disk free**.

- **What it does:**  
It shows how much disk space is used and available on all mounted filesystems.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
df
```
This lists disk usage in blocks (default size).

- **Why it's useful:**
Helps you check disk space quickly.

## df -BG
- **What it means:**
The -B option tells df to show sizes in blocks of a specified size, and G means gigabytes.

- **What it does:**
df -BG shows disk space usage with sizes rounded and labeled in gigabytes.

- **Simple example:**
```bash
df -BG
```
his lists disk usage in gigabytes, making it easier to read and understand.

- **Why it's useful:**
Useful for a clear, human-readable view of disk space in GB.

## top -bn1

- **What it means:**  
`top` is a command that shows real-time system processes.  
The options `-b` and `-n1` modify its behavior:
  - `-b` means **batch mode** (outputs data once instead of interactive mode).  
  - `-n1` means **show only one iteration** (just one snapshot).

- **What it does:**  
`top -bn1` prints a single snapshot of the current running processes and system resource usage in a non-interactive way.

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
top -bn1
```
This command outputs one snapshot of CPU, memory, and process info, then exits.

- **Why it's useful:**
Useful for scripts or logging when you want to capture system status once without opening the interactive top interface.

## who -b

- **What it means:**  
`who` shows who is logged into the system.  
The `-b` option means **boot time**.

- **What it does:**  
`who -b` displays the last time the system was rebooted (booted).

```bash
who -b
```
This prints the system’s last boot time.

- **Why it's useful:**
Great for quickly checking when the system was last restarted.

## ss -t

- **Simple example:**  
```bash
lsblk
```
This command lists disks and their partitions, showing sizes, types, and mount points.

- `-w` counts **words**.

- **What it does:**  
- `wc -l` counts how many lines are in a file or input.  
- `wc -w` counts how many words are in a file or input.
